# web-worker-js
A Web Worker is a script that runs in a background threads, separate from the main thread. Web workers enable the browser to execute multiple threads of JavaScript in parallel with each other. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface. Once created, a worker can send messages to the JavaScript code that created it by posting messages to an event handler specified by that code (and vice versa).
